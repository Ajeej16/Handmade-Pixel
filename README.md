# Handmade-Pixel

## Introduction
Learning difficult concepts can be confusing at times, and that's normal. As humans, we're capable of higher-level thinking, but we have limits - especially in fields like computer science. Translating an idea into something a computer understands can be challenging, even for those with experience.

### The Problem
This challenge has led to the rise of online educational content that utilizes visuals to break down these subjects. One such channel is 3Blue1Brown, run by Grant Sanderson. In his videos, he explains a range of concepts with a "highly visual approach" (Wei, 2020).  The graphics that he integrates into his videos helps to demystify concepts that are widely understood to be complex. As Sanderson said, "[w]hen we put the visuals first, then start to articulate the meaning, you can get a sense of ownership over it" (Wei, 2020). This ownership creates a connection between the person in the content, both reinforcing understanding and keeping their attention.
While these resources can make the material more approachable, they often fall short in providing meaningful interaction. Beginners may be amazed by how digestible the concepts become due to its presentation, yet struggle to engage with the content on a deeper level. 

### The Solution
This project is focused on fostering this deeper understanding with computer graphics. By combining visuals with an interactive learning experience, Handmade Pixel will create a for effective learning environment for those interested in graphics.
This site will integrate graphical windows that will allow users to both visualize and interface with the concepts being covered in real time. Walking through the math and computer science heavy concepts of computer graphics with these tools will present the information in a more digestible format, creating a friendly learning environment for users of any skill level.

## Components

### Web Frontend
The website will be designed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with emphasis ona user-friendly interface.

### Web Backend
A custom Rust server powers the website, using MySQL for database management and Actix Web as the framework. 

### Graphics Backend
A graphics engine developed in C and OpenGL will create interactive applications, converted to web-compatible files using Emscripten.
